Reddit Scrape Chrome Extension
======

A Chrome Extension aimed at making it easier to "scrape" stories from Reddit, to be used in conjunction with my [Scary Story Anthology](https://christinab.dev/portfolio/scary-stores-about-camping-a-web-app-chrome-extension/).
 
The goal of the extension is to allow me to save a story's author, permalink, and content and send to a webservice hosted by me, to save it for my own personal use.
